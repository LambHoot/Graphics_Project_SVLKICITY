Hi,

All requested keyboard inputs have been implemented, with the addition of T which toggles the 
visibility of tangent lines.The program writes all spline segment point data to an input.txt file. 
Unfortunately I am unable to run assignment 1 within this project, so to make it work, I have 
included a copy of my A1. By manually editing the input file, both assignments become compatible.
It is advised however to reduce the quality of the spline by lowering the number of points per spline
segment when doing this, as A1 may take a while to build the surface.

I used VS2013

Also, I had some weird problem with symbols or something, and I had to import some stuff.
So just in case I can't get it to work on a school workstation, a video of it working can be found here:

Thanks!
